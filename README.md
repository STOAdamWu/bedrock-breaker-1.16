# bedrock-breaker-1.16
a 1.16 minecraft datapack allows to easily break bedrock
# Why this
Back to 1.12, it is very is to remove bedrock with dragon eggs. However, this glitch is fixed since 1.13, which makes it very hard to break the bedrock( but still possible). In this datapack, you can break bedrock very simply this throw my bedrock breaker on the bedrock( but no other blocks). Then, with a big bang, bedrock is removed.
